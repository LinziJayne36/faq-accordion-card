## Welcome to my GitHub world! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my take on this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help us improve our coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

My challenge was to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
